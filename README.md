# ArducamPython

Python wrapper for Arducam library. The official library provided by Arducam does not work.
Therefore I had to write a new libary. Library has not been tested

## Installation
```
pip3 install pybind
sudo apt -y install cmake
```
## Compile Notes
```
cmake -H. -Bbuild & make -C ./build
```
